This is a gallery of the various sites that I worked on during my short time 
working for Advision E-Commerce.

It's a job that I landed, with the role of a Freelance Front-End Developer. At 
the time, I thought it was what I wanted. It paid $30/hr (which is the same as 
I had been making at my job with the MARA group), and the freedom that freelance 
work alluded to appealed to me.

Unfortunately, things didn't work out, and I believe that was for a couple of 
different reasons.

1. I was supposed to be receiving E.I. at the time, however I made a little bit 
of money freelancing (not even from this job), and I made the unfortunate decision 
to tell the government that... Rather than being reasonable, and talking to me, 
instead they completely froze my account... for a period of several months. Which meant 
that instead of having a graceful, supported entry into the lifestyle of a freelancer, 
I was suddenly depending on it in order to pay rent, and this job didn't pay 
enough to pay rent.

I was forced to find another freelance gig that did pay rent (Sustainergy). That 
worked, however that required so much of my time/energy (tight deadlines, unreasonable 
founder) that, when work did actually come about for this position, I wasn't 
actually in a good place to deliver on it.

2. This position was for Front End Development, and starting out, I wasn't fast. 
Now, normally, were this a full-time job, it's to be expected that it will take 
time to get up to speed. That's a part of the process, and after a few months of 
consistent efforts within a stack, you're almost guaranteed to get good... Or at least 
I am. When, instead, what I'm doing is putting in a few hours here and there, 
not even every week? It didn't really help.

It's not to say I couldn't do Front-End Development, but rather, instead of 
whatever it is that I already knew, it required using esoteric HTML elements to 
style form elements, sliders, etc... Real tricky stuff. In the modern age, I'd 
just ask ChatGPT for help, and it'd be fine, but back then I really struggled.

I found my next job doing Full-Stack Development for Sustainergy to be much 
more in line with my skillset, and the hours were much closer to full-time, which 
I quite liked. Nonetheless, I did in fact complete work for these people, and 
so I hope you've enjoyed the aforeprovided gallery of my work here.
