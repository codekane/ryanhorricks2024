Scope of work included Push Notifications, which were successfully implemented. Given the Android app had no 
faculties for Authentication, I did that too, and I even went a bit too far, and setup Registration.

Behind the scenes, I took a disparate, undocumented codebase worked on primarily by Juniors, and bestowed upon it 
order, patterns, Best Practices, and, get this: Documentation. This was done using Java, implementing the MVVM pattern, with a single-activity, 
many fragments, and JWT for Authentication.
