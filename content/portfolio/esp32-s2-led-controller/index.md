title: "ESP32-S2 LED Controller"
summary: "Continuing with my experiments, and my penchant for using spare parts, I built another controller using the ESP32-S2. I equipped it with a rotary encoder, however my prime interest was in seeing how limited the S2 was compared to the S3, when being tasked with audio processing. The answer was quite - it did in fact work, however it came at the cost of UI responsiveness, with the web server often slowing to a crawl, and the audio processing time entering into the DANGER ZONE."

This is another bunch of words. Obviously, OBVIOUSLY, **obviously** in need of some 
actual word-content. It's just that there's SO MUCH TO BE SAID. It's obscene how much 
work I put into this project, and the fact that none of it has been documented has meant that 
it's been weeks of efforts, poring over every thing that I ever did, finding evidence in every 
place that it can be found, and bringing it all together, just for you to look at.
