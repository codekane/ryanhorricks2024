title: "ESP8266 Split Rail LED Controller"
summary: "Looking to experiment, I created another controller for a fixed installation using some parts I had lying around. It drives a single string of 5V addressable LED's, as well as a strip of analog 12V LED's, both being powered from either 5V USB pass-through, or a single Lithium Polymer Battery. What's more, using experimental firmware, I was able to have it sync to the audio reactive data from my other devices (without needing to do the processing itself)."

This is a bunch of text to get the image formatting to work right. It needs to be long 
enough to go for a full line, so that everything else at least looks passably decent.
