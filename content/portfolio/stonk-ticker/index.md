description: "Scrapes /r/wallstbets, counts stocks by mention, and looks up data using the unofficial Yahoo Finance API."
summary: "Designed to scrape the reddit /wallstbets subreddit, and count stocks by mention, to try to gain insights into what people are talking about. Built with a Ruby/Python back-end, and a  React front-end, it uses the unofficial YahooFinance API to corroborate the mentioned stocks with their actual real-time data (using Redis to cache the... inconsistent API responses, and maintain application functionality)."
