description: "Front-End Development for an artist who inherited her father's empire."
summary: "My work as a Front-End Developer for CreativeMite - using .NET WebForms, this was my first foray into C#, and also my first full-time role as a developer. I got poached by MARA a couple of months in, and doubled my money, but this was nonetheless a very important stepping stone in my career."
