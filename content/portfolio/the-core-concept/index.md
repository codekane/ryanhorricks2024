title: "The Core Concept"
summary: "A retrospective look at what I sought to achieve with this project - the ability to have an entire outfit sychronized to the sounds of music, together in harmony. I actually achieved my proof of concept, and I did so by combining two fixed controller installations with the Alpha prototype. Together, I proved that what I want can, in fact, be achieved. This is The Core Concept."

## Why
I started this project on the first day of 2023 (or rather, New Years Eve, 2022). 

The inspiration was born of something I'd made years earlier, in 2019, out of a hat I found in the Lost & Found at [Sasquatch Gathering](https://www.facebook.com/SasquatchGathering/), combined with a string of lights that I now 
know came out of the dollar store. At that festival, those lights had come in clutch. I was working as a volunteer, and their was a storm on the Saturday night of my shift... It was bad. Tents were upturned, people ran away, and 
the relief shift never showed. It wound up being that those very lights were the only source of light for those of us in the volunteer shack...

And then I had to leave. I had my own friends to mind, 

That's an incident that ate at it. It gnawed at me. I wanted to find fault -- anyone to take the blame, accept responsibility, or perhaps to simply do something; take action, and make the world a better place - a place where 
there is enough light, to keep away the darkness (and the scary things you'll find there).

I came back from that festival, and I was deeply bothered, and it was out of that bother that I found my Art. 




## Foreword

This is a bunch of words so that I can get the formatting to work properly. I'm laying down all of the audio/video 
content I can find for these works first, so that I can build the article around it. If you're seeing this before 
I've done that, then: thanks for looking!

## Alpha PowerPack Upgrade
I'm not sure which this one was for. It might have actually gone into the Alpha (because I upgraded it after 
I made the rest of these).
