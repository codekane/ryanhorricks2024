summary: "My work as a System Analyst with the MARA Group, helping to bring a SAAS Product to launch in the Digital Health space."
summary: "Brought on as the Sole Technical Hire to perform QA on a SAAS Application in the Virtual Health Space, developed by an outsourced Ukrainian development firm. This was my first startup experience, and I got to wear a lot of hats, including defending our rationale against the SR/ED board, and substantial efforts in creating a Product Roadmap, and Bug-Tracking System in Jira, creating designs in Figma, and developing websites in WebFlow."
