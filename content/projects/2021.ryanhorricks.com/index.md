**Project:** 2021 Version of ryanhorricks.com + ISBN Lookup Tool  
**Role:** Solo Developer

## Overview
In 2021, I created a new version of my personal website using **WordPress**. This iteration was designed to 
experiment with new features, refine my understanding of WordPress development, and prepare myself to better 
serve clients in this space. One notable addition was a **Library** feature, designed to catalog my personal book 
collection. To support this, I built a simple **ISBN Lookup Tool** that retrieved book details from ISBN numbers 
via external API's. Though the Library feature was ultimately removed, these 
projects served as valuable exercises in learning, iteration, and personal branding.

## Challenges and Objectives
- **WordPress Mastery:** Building a functional site to explore WordPress features and improve client-readiness.
- **Library Feature:** Developing a unique feature to showcase my personal book collection.
- **Data Automation Assistance:** Creating a tool to streamline the process of gathering book data through ISBN lookups.
- **Experimentation and Design:** Using this version of the site to test design ideas and other experiments.

### 2. Library Feature and ISBN Lookup Tool
- Developed the **ISBN Lookup Tool** as a stand-alone webpage to retrieve book details from ISBN numbers.

### 3. Experimentation and Branding
