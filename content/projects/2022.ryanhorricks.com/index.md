## Overview
The **2022 version** of my personal website marked a significant leap forward, built using **React** 
and **Gatsby** and deployed via **Netlify**. This iteration reflected a commitment to creating something I 
could genuinely take pride in, with an emphasis on performance, responsiveness, and design clarity. Designed 
to showcase my skills and personality, this site served as both a portfolio and a playground for exploring 
new technologies and techniques.

## Challenges and Objectives
