## Overview
The **Kageshi Browser Extension** was a collaborative project aimed at extending the functionality of the 
now-defunct video chat website, **ezcapechat** (formerly known as Kageshi). With the platform’s transition 
from Flash to JavaScript, our small team took the opportunity to develop a **Firefox/Chrome extension** that 
added creative and practical features for users. This project blended reverse engineering with innovative 
front-end development, showcasing the potential for browser-based extensions to enhance user experiences.

## Challenges and Objectives
- **Reverse Engineering:** Understanding the newly implemented JavaScript front-end to identify integration points for the extension.
- **Feature Extension:** Adding new functionalities to enhance the base experience of the video chat platform.

## My Contributions

### 1. Reverse Engineering
- Analyzed the **JavaScript-based front-end** of the platform, identifying opportunities to integrate new features.
- Collaborated with the team to document the site’s behaviors and core functions, ensuring compatibility with the extension.

### 2. Extension Development
- Developed the extension using **JavaScript**, focusing on creating a robust and modular codebase.
- Implemented several interactive features to extend the functionality of the chat platform, making it more engaging for users.
- Ensured compatibility with both **Firefox** and **Chrome** browsers, adhering to the standards of their respective WebExtension APIs.

### 3. Collaborative Development
- Worked closely with a small team of developers to brainstorm and implement creative ideas for the extension.
- Contributed to versioning and collaborative workflows via GitHub to streamline the development process.

## Outcomes and Results
