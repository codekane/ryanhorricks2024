## Overview

**ryanhorricks.com** represents the culmination of seven years of professional growth, personal evolution, 
and technical mastery. Created over four months and across four countries, this website serves as both a 
portfolio and a narrative, showcasing a journey of innovation, self-discovery, and reflection.

The project is more than a technical showcase; it’s a deeply personal work. Each article reflects a chapter 
of my life, offering insights into professional achievements, personal struggles, and the lessons learned 
along the way.

## Challenges and Objectives
- **Comprehensive Content:** Creating detailed, professional, and engaging content for every significant project and experience over seven years.
- **Efficiency and Quality:** Leveraging tools like AI to streamline the process while maintaining a high standard of writing.
- **Global Effort:** Building and refining the website while traveling through Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
- **Polished Design:** Ensuring a professional and cohesive aesthetic using the Hugo framework and Blowfish theme.
- **Analytics Insights:** Using analytics to understand how the site was being consumed and to guide content improvement.

## My Contributions
### 1. Conceptualization and Structure
- Designed the website to distinguish between **Portfolio** (professional and high-effort personal projects) and **Projects** (passion-driven works).
- Ensured every article provided technical depth while being accessible to a general audience.

### 2. Leveraging AI for Efficiency
- Initially wrote content manually, spending weeks on single articles. Transitioned to using AI (ChatGPT) for summarizing, editing, and refining content, dramatically improving efficiency and quality.
- Used AI not only as a tool but as a learning process, understanding how to best utilize it for creative and technical tasks.

### 3. Analytics for Insights
- Integrated analytics into the site to monitor traffic patterns and gain actionable insights.
- Observed spikes in traffic immediately after job applications, often in the early hours of the application’s time zone.
- Identified patterns of AI-based evaluations for jobs that included website links on resumes. Analytics revealed that AI tools likely assessed the content before being passed to human reviewers.
- Tracked specific user behavior, including where visitors stopped reading, allowing targeted improvements to underdeveloped sections.
- Notable instances, such as a surge of over 20 hits from Microsoft following an application, highlighted the importance of polished and complete content.

### 4. Technical Implementation
- Built the website using **Hugo** for its speed and flexibility, and the **Blowfish theme** for its professional design with minimal front-end development.
- Focused on performance and scalability by creating a static site, ensuring fast load times and robust user experience.

### 5. Comprehensive Content Creation
- Authored detailed articles covering every major professional and personal project over the past seven years.
- Integrated lessons learned, challenges faced, and outcomes achieved to create a narrative that is both technical and personal.

## Process and Progress
- Integrated lessons learned, challenges faced, and outcomes achieved to create a narrative that is both technical and personal.
- Traveled through Kuala Lumpur, Siem Reap, Phnom Penh, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang, continuously refining and expanding the content.
- Engaged in conversations with peers and mentors who encouraged the use of AI tools and a focus on progress over perfection.
- Returned to Kuching for the final push, completing the content and achieving a cohesive, polished result.

## Lessons Learned
1. **The Power of AI:** Using AI transformed this project, enabling me to produce higher-quality content in a fraction of the time.
2. **Reflection Through Writing:** Revisiting past projects was both challenging and healing, offering new perspectives on personal growth and professional achievements.
3. **Perfection vs. Progress:** This website taught me to balance high standards with practicality, focusing on delivering results rather than endless refinement.
4. **Actionable Analytics:** Real-time analytics highlighted areas for improvement and revealed the value of presenting polished, engaging content to both AI and human reviewers.
